- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Trividh15, actual name Devansh Mandloi.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding and exploring the world of Computer Science as a Second Year Btech. Student! I am also interested in Cloud Computing, so I have opted for Cloud as my major specialization for the coming semesters.
- ðŸ’» I learned to code in 'C" and "Python" in the first and second semesters of college and I have also learned "HTML" and "CSS".
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and Javascript. Also, I have taken a course on AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials, which I hope to finish soon.
- ðŸ“« I am also a musician and love to talk about music and technology. You can contact me via Email @devanshmandloi312004@gmail.com.\
- âœ… Thanks for visiting my profile; I hope you find it interesting. Looking forward to connecting with as many people as I can to share and grow my knowledge!
