- 👋 Hi, I’m @Trividh15, actual name Devansh Mandloi.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and exploring the world of Computer Science as a Second Year Btech. Student! I am also interested in Cloud Computing, so I have opted for Cloud as my major specialization for the coming semesters.
- 💻 I learned to code in 'C" and "Python" in the first and second semesters of college and I have also learned "HTML" and "CSS".
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and Javascript. Also, I have taken a course on AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials, which I hope to finish soon.
- 📫 I am also a musician and love to talk about music and technology. You can contact me via Email @devanshmandloi312004@gmail.com.\
- ✅ Thanks for visiting my profile; I hope you find it interesting. Looking forward to connecting with as many people as I can to share and grow my knowledge!
